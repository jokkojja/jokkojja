Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Kirill Frolov, a Python Backend Developer with 4+ years of experience building production-ready services.

* Strong background in Python, specialized in FastAPI, Asyncio, and aiohttp
* Designed and deployed microservices architectures with REST and gRPC APIs
* Hands-on experience with event-driven systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, Dramatiq)
* Worked with SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB, Redis)
* Built CI/CD pipelines, test automation (Pytest, Behave), and observability (Grafana, Sentry, Telegraf)
* Also mentoring and tech interviews

Iâ€™m passionate about scalable backend systems, distributed architectures, and highload applications.
Currently, Iâ€™m exploring new approaches in backend design and always open to interesting collaborations.
